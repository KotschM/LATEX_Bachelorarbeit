Due to the constant growth of modern software systems, the share of unused code passages and features is also growing. Within this practice work a first view of the analysis possibilities for the identification of unused code is to be pointed out. In order to accomplish such an analysis, one uses the results of the two analysis kinds \glqq static code analysis\grqq{} and \glqq dynamic code analysis\grqq{}. In addition to an explanation of both types of analysis, a concept and the associated implementation for dynamic code analysis will also be presented, based on the Enisco Manufacturing Execution System (E-MES for short) from the company Enisco by Forcam GmbH.
