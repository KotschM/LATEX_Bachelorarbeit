@book{Shahi.2015,
 abstract = {Apache Solr: A Practical Approach to Enterprise Search teaches you how to build an enterprise search engine using Apache Solr. You'll soon learn how to index and search your documents; ingest data from varied sources; pre-process, transform and enrich your data; and build the processing pipeline. You will understand the concepts and internals of Apache Solr and tune the results for your client's search needs. The book explains each essential concept-backed by practical and industry examples-to help you attain expert-level knowledge. The book, which assumes a basic knowledge of Java, starts with an introduction to Solr, followed by steps to setting it up, indexing your first set of documents, and searching them. It then covers the end-to-end process of data ingestion from varied sources, pre-processing the data, transformation and enrichment of data, building the processing pipeline, query parsing, and scoring the document. It also teaches you how to make your system intelligent and able to learn through feedback loops. After covering out-of-the-box features, Solr expert Dikshant Shahi dives into ways you can customize Solr for your business and its specific requirements, along with ways to plug in your own components. Most important, you will learn to handle user queries and retrieve meaningful results. The book explains how each user query is different and how to address them differently to get the best result. And because document ranking doesn 't work the same for all applications, the book shows you how to tune Solr for the application at hand and re-rank the results. You'll see how to influence user experience by providing suggestions and recommendations, and leveraging other interesting features of Solr. You'll also see how to integrate Solr with important related technologies like OpenNLP, Apache Tika, and Apache UIMA, among others, to take your search capabilities to the next level. This book concludes with case studies and industry examples, the knowledge of which will be helpful in designing components and putting the bits together. By the end of Apache Solr, you will be proficient in designing, architecting, and developing your search engine and be able to integrate it with other systems



Build an enterprise search engine using Apache Solr: index and search documents; ingest data from varied sources; apply various text processing techniques; utilize different search capabilities; and customize Solr to retrieve the desired results. Apache Solr: A Practical Approach to Enterprise Search explains each essential concept-backed by practical and industry examples--to help you attain expert-level knowledge. The book, which assumes a basic knowledge of Java, starts with an introduction to Solr, followed by steps to setting it up, indexing your first set of documents, and searching them. It then introduces you to information retrieval and its implementation in Apache Solr; this will help you understand your search problem, decide the approach to build an effective solution, and use various metrics to evaluate the results. The book next covers the schema design and techniques to build a text analysis chain for cleansing, normalizing and enriching your documents and addressing different types of search queries. It describes various popular matching techniques which are generally applied to improve the precision and recall of searches. You will learn the end-to-end process of data ingestion from varied sources, metadata extraction, pre-processing and transformation of content, various search components, query parsers and other advanced search capabilities. After covering out-of-the-box features, Solr expert Dikshant Shahi dives into ways you can customize Solr for your business and its specific requirements, along with ways to plug in your own components. Most important, you will learn about implementations for Solr scoring, factors affecting the document score, and tuning the score for the application at hand. The book explains why textual scoring is not sufficient for practical ranking of documents and ways to integrate real-world factors for contributing to the document ranking. You'll see how to influence user experience by providing suggestions and recommendations. You'll also see integration of Solr with important related technologies such as OpenNLP and Tika. Additionally, you will learn about scaling Solr using SolrCloud. This book concludes with coverage of semantic search capabilities, which is crucial for taking the search experience to the next level. By the end of Apache Solr, you will be proficient in designing and developing your search engine},
